#Linear Search Algorithm
- Why is it the slowest?
- The Linear search algorithm works by checking each element in its data set until the target value is found. Due to this structure of work if the target value was in the last index of a data set it would have to read all of the data.
#Binary & Interpolation Algorithm
- The reason binary and intorpolation search algortihms are faster is because they rely on a sorted data set. If the data set is sorted each of these algorithms are able to cut their data sets in half due to their work flow. Depending on how the dataset is sorted, binary and interpolation can be faster than the other.
